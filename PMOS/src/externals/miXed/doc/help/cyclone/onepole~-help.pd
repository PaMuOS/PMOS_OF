#X text 56 272 onepole's advantages are efficiency and simplicity.
it works well as a pre- or post-processing stage for other treatments
\, such as waveshaping or filtering \, which can benefit from a gentle
roll-off of high frequencies.;
#X text 38 124 this filter is equivalent to a biquad~ object with the
coefficients \, [ a0 = k \, b1 = k - 1 ] \, as demonstrated below.

generates a single-pole lowpass filter with a 6dB/octave attenuation.
