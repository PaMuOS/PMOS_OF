#X text 41 63 Cyclone is a library of Pure Data classes \, bringing
some level of compatibility between Max/MSP and Pd environments. Although
being itself in the early stage of development \, it is meant to eventually
become part of a much larger project \, aiming at unification and standardization
of computer musician's tools. In its current form \, cyclone is mainly
for people using both Max and Pd \, and thus wanting to develop cross-platform
patches \, but it also provide many very useful objects for the Pd-only
user.;
